            <p class="lead">Are you sure you want to remove/archive the map "{{ rms.name }}"?</p>
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The map will no longer be randomly presented on the main page.</li>
                <li>The map will no longer show up in searches or lists of maps.</li>
                <li>The map will no longer show up in your list of your own maps.</li>
                <li>Nobody will be able to add the map to collections.</li>
                <li>You will no longer be able to edit the map.</li>
                <li>Users will no longer be able to express their affection towards the map.</li>
                <li><strong>You will not be able to remove the "archived" status from your map again.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The map will remain accessible directly via its url, but a giant "archived" warning will greet each
                    visitor.
                </li>
                <li>The map will remain part of any collection it is currently a part of, until it is removed from the
                    collection.
                </li>
                <li>The map will still be displayed in the changelog of other versions of this map.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>We might actually delete archived maps that look to us like they were uploaded
                    errorneously.</strong>
                Marking maps as archived is a relatively new feature, and its functionality is due to change.

            <p class="font-italic">Now that you know what you are doing, do you really want to remove/archive the map
